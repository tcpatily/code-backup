The hotels will either be those shown in the itinerary or of the same category. Due to trade fairs and conventions in the cities the hotels may be blocked out for more than 2 yrs in advance. In view of this you may have to stay in hotels further away from the cities and itineraries may have to be altered / amended. Since the rooms are comparatively small, we would recommend only 3 persons in one room for your own comfort. Triple rooms are usually no larger than twin rooms and the third bed is often a rollaway cot put in a twin room for the night. Also due to favourable conditions in certain countries, most of the hotels may not have air conditioners / fans. All baggage and personal effects are at all times and under all circumstances your responsibility. We will not be responsible or liable in case of loss or theft or damage of such items from the hotel premises / Coach / Cruise / Airport / during travel or place of visit etc. Some hotels offer the facility of safe deposit lockers, which can be availed of by you at your own cost and risk.

Payment towards FX component made in INR has to come directly from the passenger keeping with RBI Guidelines. The card that is swiped for payment of the tour&rsquo;s foreign exchange should be of the client himself / herself. Client cannot use his / her card for payment of another person&rsquo;s foreign exchange component of the tour package except for his / her dependent parents and / or child or children. The FX payment is a part of BTQ (Basic Travel Quota) of the Client.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-IN\">3% service charges (i.e. remittance charges) would be applicable, if client chooses to pay us in Foreign currency notes. Proof of purchase from Full Fledged Money Changer (FFMC) should accompany such payments made by Client when above USD 2000. Client holding a passport issued by a country other than India will be required to make payment in foreign currency for the foreign currency component of the tour cost and not in INR. Payment Procedure: We urge our Customers to ensure that all payment/(s) are made to our Company's designated Bank account only and to insist on a printed payment acknowledgement slip and receipt. Customer should not make payment/(s) to any staff or individual&rsquo;s bank account or any third party bank account, in the event of which the Customer shall be solely responsible and/or liable for the consequences thereof and the Company hereby expressly disclaims any responsibility and/or liability arising thereto.<br /><br /></span></p>\n<table style=\"height: 253px;

Hence sometimes they may be located away from the city centre. Most of the rooms have private bath or shower. The hotels will either be those shown in the itinerary or of the same category. Due to trade fairs and conventions in the cities the hotels may be blocked out for more than 2 yrs in advance. In view of this you may have to stay in hotels further away from the cities and itineraries may have to be altered / amended. Since the rooms are comparatively small, we would recommend only 3 persons in one room for your own comfort. Triple rooms are usually no larger than twin rooms and the third bed is often a rollaway cot put in a twin room for the night. All baggage and personal effects are at all times and under all circumstances your responsibility. We will not be responsible or liable in case of loss of such items from the hotel premises / coach / Cruise / Airport / during travel or place of visit etc. Some hotels offer the facility of safe deposit lockers, which can be availed of by you at your own cost and risk.

The hotels will either be those shown in the itinerary or of the same category. Due to trade fairs and conventions in the cities the hotels may be blocked out for more than 2 yrs in advance. In view of this you may have to stay in hotels further away from the cities and itineraries may have to be altered / amended.

Triple rooms are usually no larger than twin rooms and the third bed is often a rollaway cot put in a twin room for the night. Also due to favourable conditions in certain countries, most of the hotels may not have air conditioners / fans. All baggage and personal effects are at all times and under all circumstances your responsibility. We will not be responsible or liable in case of loss or theft or damage of such items from the hotel premises / Coach / Cruise / Airport / during travel or place of visit etc. Some hotels offer the facility of safe deposit lockers, which can be availed of by you at your own cost and risk.

The blue water and sunset during the afternoon is a fun way to spend time with your kids on a boat. Or take your kids to a gelato shop, at the Barrio Santa Cruz or the Jewish Quarter just outside the Cathedral. Sit near a fountain with your kids while having helado, or shop for gifts and toys at the nearby shops. You should also visit the Isla Magica, a massive theme park with multiple rides.</p>",

It has beautiful monuments dating back to the 19<sup>th</sup>century, along with many Renaissance and Baroque buildings. One of Spain&rsquo;s frequently visited monument known as the Alhambra or &lsquo;the palace city&rsquo; is in Granada. The palace city consists of the Alcazaba, a citadel, and various other parts. One would also be interested in the palace and gardens of the Generalife and the Nasrid Palaces. The Alhambra is a walled city. The Nasrid sultans, their senior officials, elite soldiers and even servants of the court resided here a long time back. A congregation of objects from the location of the monument and the Museum of Fine Arts can be found in the Museum of the Alhambra. Another beautiful place to visit in Granada is the Generalife which is a garden attached to the Alhambra. Once a place of relaxation for the Muslim kings, it is now one of the biggest tourist attractions of Granada.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">&nbsp;</span></p>",
